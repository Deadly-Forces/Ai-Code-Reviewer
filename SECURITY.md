## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a high priority for us. If you discover a security vulnerability in AI Code Reviewer, please report it privately.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to the repository owner or open a GitHub Security Advisory privately via the "Security" tab on the GitHub repository.

### What to Expect
- You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours.
- We will work with you to verify the vulnerability and determine the timeline for a fix.
- Once the issue is resolved, we will publish a security patch and credit you for discovering the vulnerability (if desired).
